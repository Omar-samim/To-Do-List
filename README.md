## Project Overview

This is a simple and interactive **To-Do List** web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently.

The user-friendly interface is responsive and designed to work seamlessly across devices of all sizes.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content
